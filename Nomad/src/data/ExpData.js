But you don’t have to be an adrenaline junkie (or even do anything remotely dangerous) to take a few risks while travelling. You could skip the Eiffel Tower in favour of a few lesser-known sights, or simply avoid Paris altogether and check out a sleepy backwater that gets far fewer visitors. Sure there’s a risk that you might be disappointed when you arrive, but the potential rewards are worth it. You might find a perfect café, get a beautiful view all to yourself, or wind up meeting the person of your dreams. For better or worse, stories get more interesting when you leave the beaten track.",

Swig from disposable bottles for a few months and you’ll create a nasty pile of plastic waste, which will stay in your holiday destination long after you’ve departed (around 500 years, according to most estimates).We’re not saying that you should drink straight from the tap in New Delhi in a bid to save the planet (definitely don’t do that), but it’s good to remember that as a visitor, you can have a disproportionately high impact on the environment. Tread as lightly as you can, and think carefully about what you’re leaving behind.",
